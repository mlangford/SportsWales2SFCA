This tool computes Floating Catchment Area (FCA) accessibility scores (and various other metrics)
aimed at determining geographical accessibility to a service. To operatate correctly it requires a
Map Layer containing points which represent the locations at which the service of interest is supplied.
Another Map Layer is needed containing points which represent the locations at which demand on this
service arises (typically these are population weighted centroids of Output Areas, LSOAs, or other tracts).

To a compute travel time or distance between these two sets of points requires a properly configured ESRI
Network Layer. Using this information the Network Analyst extension can compute an Origin-Destination matrix
between the two point datasets. The points held in both of the point layers must have been "pre-snapped" to
the selected network layer using the "Add Locations" tool in the Network Analyst Toolbox. From the O-D matrix
FCA scores and other accessibility metrics are computed and the results placed in a ArcGIS table for consumption.

Further instructions are provided in accompanying documenation.
